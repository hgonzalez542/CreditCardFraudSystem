# üí≥ Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection Web App

This is a full-stack web application that detects potentially fraudulent credit card transactions in real time using the [FraudLabs Pro API](https://www.fraudlabspro.com). The project simulates a real-world fraud detection workflow used by financial institutions, with a modern frontend built in React.js and a backend developed using Python Flask.

## üß† How It Works

1. **React Form** collects user input.
2. On submit, **Axios** sends the transaction data to the Flask backend.
3. Flask sends a `POST` request to the FraudLabs Pro API with `action=CHECK`.
4. The API returns an **XML response** with fraud risk details.
5. Flask parses the XML using `ElementTree` and returns a clean JSON.
6. **React displays** the fraud result and the transaction is also visible in your [FraudLabs Pro Dashboard](https://www.fraudlabspro.com/merchant/dashboard).
